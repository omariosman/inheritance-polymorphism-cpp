I created this project with g++ compiler on ubuntu 

Project structure:
The project files are organized into three directories: cpp, headers, obj, and executable
I also created a Makefile if you wanted to re-generate the executable file again 

Commands:
- make clean
  To remove the "obj" and "executable" directories and their contents.
- make
  This will compile the C++ source files, create an executable in the "executable" directory
